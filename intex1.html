     True love fosters a connection that goes beyond the superficial. It's a bond that often involves understanding each other's core values, beliefs, and life goals. This connection creates a sense of companionship, where both partners feel they're on the same team, working towards common dreams. </li>     
     <li class="two"> Love is a set of emotions and behaviors characterized by intimacy, passion, and commitment. It involves care, closeness, protectiveness, attraction, affection, and trust. Love can vary in intensity and can change over time.</li>   
      
     <li class="three">“I love you more than words can express” “I love you more than I did yesterday, but not as much as tomorrow” "I will love you until the end of time".I love you more every second". I love you, forever and always”" </li>
     <li class="four">Love is not an acronym so it does not have any full form. Although people have defined the Love Fulll form by own. Love is one of the most beautiful feeling that we experience as humans. It is a variety of different feelings, states and emotions that range from interpersonal affection to pleasure.</li>
     <li class="five">Unconditional acceptance and support are also key to true love. The same way you don't speak poorly of each other, it is also important that you accept and support one another in the best and worst of times. This doesn't mean that you evade difficult truths. In true love, you can trust that you can be honest.</li>
      <li class="six">Love has deep empathy. "When you hurt, I hurt." People who truly love one another don't want to hurt them. They want them to feel good. They care about their feelings and try everything they can to make them feel valued and worthy.</li>
     <li class="seven">Hallett describes this love as a compassionate love for everyone, also known as universal loving-kindness. It's the love you feel for all living things without question, that you extend knowingly without expectations for anything in return. It's a very pure and conscious love.</li>
     <li class="eight">However, first loves are rarely last loves. One problematic outcome of this chemical system is that first loves often flounder on a catastrophic mismatch between strength of feelings and future viability.</li>
     <li class="one">”Love is always patient and kind. It is never jealous. Love is never boastful or conceited. It is never rude or selfish. It does not take offense and is not resentful. Love takes no pleasure in other people’s sins, but delights in the truth. It is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure whatever comes.”</li>
     <li class="two">“To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.” –</li>
      <li class="one">. “It was a million tiny little things that, when you added them all up, they meant we were supposed to be together…and I knew it. I knew it the very first time I touched her.”</li>
         <li class="two"> I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, I can’t do anything but think about him. At night I dream of him, all day I wait to see him, and when I do see him my heart turns over and I think I will faint with desire.”</li>
      <li class="one"> “I feel wonderful because I see the love light in your eyes and the wonder of it all, is that you just don’t realize how much I love you.”</li>
         <li class="two">She obviously loves her family very much. You have to love in order to be loved. He swore that he loved her madly. She said she could never marry a man she didn't love.</li>
      <li class="one">Staying in love and maintaining a relationship is a daily effort and doesn’t end at “I love you.” Subtly reminding your partner that you are still in love with them signals that they are desired and that the chemistry between you two is thriving.</li>
